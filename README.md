The application also supports customization with the choice to change the background as well as add an overlay or center image. It also allows for the ability to add more rotating particles as well as change the lengths and colors of the trails.

Please note that the usage of Wallpaper Engine is absolutely necessary in order for the scripts to work. The customization and audio listeners are prebuilt from the engine. The trails have been programmed to hide themselves until there is audio.
